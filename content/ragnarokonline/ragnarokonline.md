#### Potions Formula
Potions creation math is still disputed however, the following equation appears to be most accurate at the moment.

Success Rate = Potion Research × 1+ Prepare Potion × 3 + Job lvl × 0.2 + [DEX](http://wiki.originsro.org/wiki/DEX "DEX") × 0.1 + [LUK](http://wiki.originsro.org/wiki/LUK "LUK") × 0.1 + [INT](http://wiki.originsro.org/wiki/INT "INT") × 0.05 + (%)

-   +20% : Red Potion, Yellow Potion, White Potion
-   +10% : Alcohol
-   +0% : Acid Bottle, Mine Bottle/Marine Sphere Bottle, Bottle Grenade, Plant Bottle
-   -5% : Blue Potion, Anodyne, Aloevera, Embryo, Elemental Potions
-   -10% : Slim White Potion, Glistening Coat

The following chances are disputed:

-   -5% or -10% : Slim Red Potion
-   -7% or -10% : Slim Yellow Potion (Between -7% and -8%)



### Pet system
| Intimacy | Hunger Level |  Point System |                           Characteristic                          |
|:--------:|:------------:|:-------------:|:-----------------------------------------------------------------:|
| Very Shy | Very Hungry  | Less than 100 | Ready to run away from bad master                                 |
| Shy      | Hungry       | 100-249       | Use moody emote such as /pif and /wah                             |
| Neutral  | Neutral      | 250-749       | Use normal emotes such as /no1 and /ok                            |
| Cordial  | Satisfied    | 750-909       | Use affectionate emote such as /lv and /kis. **Bonuses to Owner** |
| Loyal    | Stuffed      | 910-1000      | Talks often and use affectionate emotes. **Bonuses to Owner**     |

-   Each pet starts at a random intimacy level ranging from 250-399. The higher level the monster, the lower the beginning intimacy level.
-   Each feeding gives different incremental points depending on the pet and it's hunger
    -   Higher level pets get less intimacy per feeding
    -   Pets get more intimacy when fed at hungry than at neutral.
-   Pet intimacy goes down by 15 points each time you die.
-   Pet intimacy does NOT go down when the pet is returned to its egg form.
-   To maximize intimacy gain per feeding, pets should be fed the moment they become hungry
-   To maximize intimacy gain in a given length of time, pets should be fed the moment they become neutral - although pets get more intimacy per feeding if they are hungry, the time between feedings outweighs this.
