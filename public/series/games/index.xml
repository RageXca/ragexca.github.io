      <description>iRO for those that don&amp;rsquo;t know Ragnarok Online a old game that started in earlys 2000&amp;rsquo;s. It was one of my favorite games including Eve-Online ,Diablo 2, Starcraft and some others (im only including those with 10k+ hours of gameplay)&#xA;Why Now? I honnestly never played renewal and decided to try official server now that they fixed the bot issues. ( Ever since they added EAC and remade part of the clien OpenmKore doesn&amp;rsquo;t work anymore on their servers ) It still won&amp;rsquo;t fix the paytowin aspect of the official client but i told myself why not?</description>
